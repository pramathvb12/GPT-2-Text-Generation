# GPT-2 Text Generation

This project demonstrates text generation using the GPT-2 language model from the transformers library.

## Overview

The code utilizes the transformers library to load a pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer. It provides a function, `generate_text`, to generate text based on a given prompt.

## How to Use

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers

Customize the prompt and adjust parameters as needed.
Dependencies

This project showcases text generation using the GPT-2 language model from the transformers library. Leveraging the power of pre-trained models, the code offers a simple Python function, generate_text, to generate diverse and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. Users can easily integrate this functionality into their projects for creative writing, chatbots, or any application requiring natural language generation.

To use the code, install the necessary library with pip install transformers and incorporate the generate_text function into your Python script. The function allows customization of prompt, model choice (default is GPT-2), and text generation parameters. The README provides concise instructions, dependencies, and acknowledgments, making it easy for users to understand, implement, and contribute.
